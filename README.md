Alternative device to install BLE GATT client-server BLE for mobile applications:  Linux PINEPHONE

Alternative setup:

- Bitalino ECG has a Matlab Toobox
- BeagleBone Blue has a Matlab step counting example
- The Matlab BLE example makes reference to Bluetooth 5.0 and shows a figure of a wrist based heart rate sports watch. Amazfit has sports watches which supports Bluetooth 5.0, for instance the Amazfit Verge light

Running Arduino code on the Beaglebone (Linux system), does also the Pyloton CLUE code run on the Pinephone with this tutorial?

Pinephone BLE Bike Computer?

Maybe a Rasperri PI zero with a 4500 mAH battery with a working time of more than 20 hrs would be the better platform than a Pinephone, which only has a working time of 3 to 4 hours with a planned extended 5000 mAH battery:
